This project is initialized with [Ant Design Pro](https://pro.ant.design). Follow is the quick guide for how to use.

## Environment Prepare

Install `node_modules`:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

## Provided Scripts

User-center provides some useful script to help you quick start and build with web project, code style check and test.

Scripts provided in `package.json`. It's safe to modify or add additional script:

### Start project

```bash
npm start
```

### Build project

```bash
npm run build
```

### Check code style

```bash
npm run lint
```

You can also use script to auto fix some lint error:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Test code

```bash
npm test
```

## Project Overview

The User Center is one of the most commonly used systems in an enterprise. In essence, it is a simple "User Management
System" that implements basic functions such as user registration, login, and query.

Although small, it is complete with all the essential components. This project represents a complete backend, from idea
generation, requirement analysis, technology selection, system design, project initialization, coding, testing, to
deployment and launch. Through this project, I have gained valuable development skills and experience truly needed in
an enterprise.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

Mainly utilizing the Alibaba Ant Design ecosystem:

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- React development framework
- Ant Design Pro project template
- Ant Design component library
- Umi development framework
- Umi Request library



### Deployment

- Single machine deployment
- Nginx
- Containers



## Project Gains

1. Learned to apply mainstream enterprise development technologies for both frontend and backend.
2. Understood the complete project workflow, enabling independent project development and launch.
3. Gained methods and experience in system design.
4. Acquired practical coding skills, such as using development tools, shortcuts, and plugins.
5. Learned code optimization techniques, such as abstraction, encapsulation, performance enhancement,
   and resource-saving methods.
6. Gained important development knowledge on login states, proxies, multi-environment setup, containers, and
   cross-origin issues.
7. Learned techniques for reading source code.
8. Improved problem-solving abilities.
