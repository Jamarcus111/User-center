> Authorï¼š[MA JIAJUN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiajun-ma-0924152b8/)


## Project Overview

The User Center is one of the most commonly used systems in an enterprise. In essence, it is a simple "User Management 
System" that implements basic functions such as user registration, login, and query.

Although small, it is complete with all the essential components. This project represents a complete backend, from idea 
generation, requirement analysis, technology selection, system design, project initialization, coding, testing, to 
deployment and launch. Through this project, I have gained valuable development skills and experience truly needed in 
an enterprise.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- Java programming language
- Spring + SpringMVC + SpringBoot framework
- MyBatis + MyBatis Plus data access framework
- MySQL database
- jUnit unit testing library



### Deployment

- Single machine deployment
- Nginx
- Containers



## Project Gains

1. Learned to apply mainstream enterprise development technologies for both frontend and backend.
2. Understood the complete project workflow, enabling independent project development and launch.
3. Gained methods and experience in system design.
4. Acquired practical coding skills, such as using development tools, shortcuts, and plugins.
5. Learned code optimization techniques, such as abstraction, encapsulation, performance enhancement, 
and resource-saving methods.
6. Gained important development knowledge on login states, proxies, multi-environment setup, containers, and 
cross-origin issues.
7. Learned techniques for reading source code.
8. Improved problem-solving abilities.
