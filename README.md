# User Management System - An Enterprise-Level Full Stack Development Project

## Introduction
An all-in-one user management system based on Spring Boot and React, implementing features such as user registration, login, query, and management.

This project is divided into two main parts:
- [Frontend](#frontend)
- [Backend](#backend)

## Features
- User registration
- User login
- User query and management
- Secure authentication
- Responsive user interface

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
Mainly utilizing the Alibaba Ant Design ecosystem:
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript
- React development framework
- Ant Design Pro project template
- Ant Design component library
- Umi development framework
- Umi Request library

### Backend
- Java programming language
- Spring + SpringMVC + SpringBoot framework
- MyBatis + MyBatis Plus data access framework
- MySQL database
- jUnit unit testing library

## Project Overview
The User Center is one of the most commonly used systems in an enterprise. In essence, it is a simple "User Management System" that implements basic functions such as user registration, login, and query.

Although small, it is complete with all the essential components. This project represents a complete backend and frontend, from idea generation, requirement analysis, technology selection, system design, project initialization, coding, testing, to deployment and launch. Through this project, I have gained valuable development skills and experience truly needed in an enterprise.
